        24 | Escape The Dark Sector                               | Argueably one of the best things to come out of 2020, and new addition to what will hopefully become more than a two part series. Escape the Dark Sector takes everything about Escape the Dark Castle that made it wonderful, and then adds guns! Thrust into the future by the imersive chapter cards, your mission remains the same, (thats right, escape!) but the challenges you'll face feel a whole lot more grown up.
