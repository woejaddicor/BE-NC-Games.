         1 | Culture a Love of Agriculture With Agricola          | You could sum up Agricola with the simple phrase 'Farmyeard Fun' but the mechanics and game play add so much more than that. You'll find yourself torn between breeding pigs, or sowing crops. Its joyeous and rewarding and it makes you think of time spent outside, which is much harder to do these days!                                                                                                                                                                            | Uwe Rosenberg     | https://images.pexels.com/photos/4917821/pexels-photo-4917821.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260 |     1 | strategy | tickle122 | 2021-01-18 10:00:20.514 |             3
        15 | Scrobble, no that's not a typo                       | You know; the one that looks a lot like Scrabble, and plays a lot like Scrabble, but you have to push the letter tiles out of cardboard becasue that makes it more "fun"...  If you're a fan of words you'll love this game regardless, but if you're a hard core word nerd you probably have the original anyway.                                                                                                                                                                       | Word Smith        | https://images.pexels.com/photos/278918/pexels-photo-278918.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260   |     1 | strategy | jessjelly | 2021-01-22 11:35:05.936 |             2
        20 | Monopoly                                             | This household classic needs no introduction. Monopoly has been causeing family fallouts for close to 90 years. With numerous special editions and no doubt more still to come almost everyone has played this game, but has anyone ever finished it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Uncredited        | https://images.pexels.com/photos/1314435/pexels-photo-1314435.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260 |     3 | strategy | grumpy19  | 2020-09-13 15:14:20.877 |             2
        17 | Nova Luna; Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah! | Loosely based around the phases of the moon, this tile placing game is rich in strategy anf makes great use of non-standard turn taking. Nova Luna was one of my favourite nominations for the prestigious Kennerspiel des Jahres in 2020. Sadly it didn't take home the title, but its an intruguing abstract game, certainly one to add to your game shelf.                                                                                                                            | Uwe Rosenburg     | https://images.pexels.com/photos/163064/play-stone-network-networked-interactive-163064.jpeg                    |     6 | strategy | tickle122 | 1970-01-10 02:56:38.4   |             3
        18 | Reef                                                 | This game reminds me of the stress-free environment described in a song sung by a crab in the famous film about a mermaid. Plenty of coral collecting, and reef building to keep you entertained                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Emerson Matsuuchi | https://images.pexels.com/photos/163064/play-stone-network-networked-interactive-163064.jpeg                    |     6 | strategy | tickle122 | 1970-01-10 02:56:38.4   |             4
         9 | Settlers of Catan: Don't Settle For Less             | You have stumbled across an uncharted island rich in natural resources, but you are not alone; other adventurers have come ashore too, and the race to settle the island of Catan has begun! Whether you exert military force, build a road to rival the Great Wall, trade goods with ships from the outside world, or some combination of all three, the aim is the same: to dominate the island. Will you prevail? Proceed strategically, trade wisely, and may the odds be in favour. | Klaus Teuber      | https://images.pexels.com/photos/163064/play-stone-network-networked-interactive-163064.jpeg                    |    16 | strategy | tickle122 | 1970-01-10 03:08:38.4   |             2
